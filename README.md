business requirements document and system design document

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DriverPass, was a business that educated student drivers via driving lessons, classes, and tests. The system that they wanted to be designed revolved around giving their business an online platform. The system would provide clients an interface to manage appointments and access online content. It would also provide employees with the ability to manage schedules and users.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I was very thorough in my analysis of the system which is represented in the business requirements document. I also thought that I illustrated the system well through the use of diagrams which can be seen in the system design document.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The areas of this project that could be explained more in-depth include the scheduling and the package payment process. The lack of explanation and definition in these areas could be improved in future iterations.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
In this project, we had a transcript from a meeting with the owner of the business. Through this transcript I was able to parse specific information and requirements to help construct the system to be tailored to the user's needs. User's needs are important to consider when designing especially when considering this type of system is intended for the user. Some system's may be more focused on providing the business more functionality, but this application is intended to be user-focused. However, creating a better environment for the user no matter the intended use, helps the user to utilize the application more efficiently.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
So far, the size of the projects and the timeline that they need to be executed in pushes me more towards a waterfall design approach in the sense that I have only be iterating the life cycle one time and, in this class, all of the client interactions and information occured at the beginning of the project. During this project I have been utilizing a model-based design approach. In the future, I would like to be able to utlize more Agile concepts like multiple iterations of the lifecycle and more interaction with the customer to ensure that they are being provided the most value from our company.
